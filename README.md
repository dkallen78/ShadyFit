# ShadyFit

A simple fitness app I had an idea for. It shows a series of exercises and gives you a timer. When you've done your exercises you go on to the next until you're done, then you rest for a bit, then you repeat it a number of times.

I think in the future I'd like to use an API for Google Sheets to keep an exercise log.

What I have is what I want the app to look like. Unfortunately, I don't have the legal right to use any of the artistic resources I have. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this, but if it gets any bigger than just me, then I'll need some new art.

I have the core of the functionality I want. The app cycles through the given exercises and then it goes to a rest. Next up is getting sets to work. Then, loading data via JSON files. Then, multiple workouts to choose from. We'll see what we can get done tomorrow...

### Update 20:50 (Mexico)

I have the very basics of the web app. I have images and buttons and a timer. Hopefully by the end of the night I'll have something working.
